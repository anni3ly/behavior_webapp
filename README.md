# behavior_webapp
The purpose of this code is to automate data processing and statistical analysis of operant box behavior data. The final output is an R-based web application with interactive capabilities. 

The code is split into folders depending on the number of experimental groups (2-3) and whether or not sex was a covariate factor. 

For an example of the final product, see https://hurd-laboratory.shinyapps.io/proteomics_behavior/
Note: This project had 3 experimental groups.
